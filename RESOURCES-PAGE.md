Section: “Top conditions people struggle with financially” (U.S.) — the 8, filled in

These are selected because they repeatedly show high medical spending, high out-of-pocket exposure, and/or high risk of financial hardship.

1) Heart disease & stroke (cardiovascular disease)

Card summary (1–2 lines)
High-cost events (ER/hospital/procedures) + lifelong medications can create large out-of-pocket exposure and ongoing premium/coinsurance strain.

How it affects an individual financially

One hospitalization can trigger large deductibles/coinsurance, then follow-up rehab and specialist visits.

Multiple chronic meds add up monthly (especially if brand-only).

Financial stress can lead to delayed follow-up, increasing risk of repeat events and costs.

High-cost triggers

ER visit + imaging; procedures; readmissions; cardiac rehab; multi-drug regimens.

What you can do

Today: Ask billing for financial assistance + an itemized bill; request generic/formulary alternatives.

This week: Confirm in-network providers; request cost estimates for planned procedures/rehab.

Ongoing: Keep documentation for appeals and coverage exceptions.

Stats (use 1–2)

Mean annual out-of-pocket healthcare expenses in families of patients with heart failure were $4,423; 14% had high burden and 5% catastrophic burden.

Nearly 50% of individuals with ASCVD and diabetes reported financial hardship from medical bills.

2) Cancer

Card summary
Treatment often brings rapid cost spikes (diagnostics, infusions, surgery, supportive meds) and can produce “financial toxicity” even for insured households.

How it affects an individual financially

Ongoing treatment can create recurring monthly costs plus travel/time off work.

High cost-sharing can make insured patients effectively underinsured.

Medical debt risk increases if treatment is prolonged or out-of-network.

High-cost triggers

Imaging, surgery, chemo/radiation cycles, specialty drugs, complications/hospitalizations.

What you can do

Today: Ask for an estimated treatment cost outline; request a social worker/financial navigator.

This week: Apply to copay foundations + hospital financial assistance; discuss lower-cost therapeutic equivalents when clinically appropriate.

Ongoing: Re-check coverage at each treatment phase; track EOBs and denials.

Stats

Review data notes insured patients pay a median $500/month out-of-pocket, and over half may be underinsured (>10% of income on care).

U.S. patients paid $5.6B out of pocket for cancer treatments in 2018 (aggregate).

3) Diabetes

Card summary
Daily/weekly needs (meds, supplies, monitoring, visits) plus complications can drive sustained monthly cost pressure.

How it affects an individual financially

Continuous expenses: medications (often multiple), monitoring supplies, labs, specialist visits.

Cost pressure can lead to rationing of critical meds/supplies, risking emergencies and higher costs.

Complications increase long-term expense and work disruption.

High-cost triggers

ER visits for hypo/hyperglycemia; complications (kidney, eye, cardiovascular); hospitalization.

What you can do

Today: Ask pharmacist/clinician about lowest-cost covered options and supply alternatives.

This week: Apply for assistance programs; confirm plan coverage rules and prior auth needs.

Ongoing: Preventive care schedule (A1C, eyes, kidneys) to reduce avoidable high-cost events.

Stats

Total estimated cost of diagnosed diabetes in the U.S. in 2022: $412.9B; average annual medical expenditures $19,736 per person.

4) Mental health conditions

Card summary
Access gaps often force out-of-network care; lower-income households can face disproportionately high out-of-pocket burdens.

How it affects an individual financially

Therapy and psychiatry costs can be high if you can’t find in-network providers.

Frequent visits + medication management can become a steady monthly expense.

Financial stress can worsen symptoms, creating a negative feedback loop.

High-cost triggers

Out-of-network therapy, crisis visits, inpatient admissions, interrupted continuity of care.

What you can do

Today: Ask your insurer for in-network options and a case manager.

This week: If no in-network providers are available, request a network adequacy exception/single-case agreement.

Ongoing: Use community clinics/sliding scale where appropriate; maintain continuity to reduce crises.

Stats

In MEPS 2018–2021, 2.4% of psychiatric outpatients had high OOP burden; among those below the federal poverty level, 12.8% did.

5) Kidney disease / kidney failure (dialysis)

Card summary
Kidney disease is associated with high total and out-of-pocket spending; kidney failure can require dialysis and extensive ongoing care.

How it affects an individual financially

Frequent labs, specialist care, multiple medications, and comorbidity management.

Dialysis adds recurring treatment time, transport costs, and coverage complexity.

Even before dialysis, out-of-pocket spending can be substantial relative to income.

High-cost triggers

Hospitalizations, progression to dialysis, transplant workups, out-of-network dialysis, complications.

What you can do

Today: Confirm your care is in-network; ask for a written cost estimate for planned services.

This week: Ask about transport help and medication assistance; review dialysis network options.

Ongoing: Keep all bills/EOBs and appeal denials promptly.

Stats

Non-dialysis CKD: annual mean out-of-pocket $1,439 (IQR $688–$2,732) in a MEPS analysis.

Total Medicare costs for ESRD were $55.3B in 2023 (all-time high).

6) COPD / severe asthma

Card summary
Inhalers and maintenance therapies plus exacerbations (ER/hospital) can drive recurring costs and sudden spikes.

How it affects an individual financially

Maintenance inhalers can be expensive, especially brand-only or non-formulary.

Exacerbations can mean urgent care/ER and hospitalization.

Work interruptions and reduced stamina can affect income.

High-cost triggers

ER/hospital admissions, oxygen therapy/equipment, repeated exacerbations.

What you can do

Today: Ask for the least expensive covered inhaler options; verify refill timing and 90-day fills.

This week: Build an exacerbation prevention plan with your clinician; confirm coverage for equipment.

Ongoing: Keep a trigger log and adhere to maintenance plan to reduce high-cost events.

Stats

Mean annual out-of-pocket spending: $325 (7.5% of COPD-specific cost); COPD-specific national cost $24.0B in the referenced analysis.

7) Arthritis (including rheumatoid arthritis)

Card summary
For inflammatory arthritis, specialty biologics can create high annual out-of-pocket exposure (especially in Medicare Part D), plus ongoing monitoring and function-related work impacts.

How it affects an individual financially

Specialty medications can create large yearly cost-sharing.

Reduced function and pain can reduce work hours and earnings.

PT, imaging, and procedures can add recurring expenses.

High-cost triggers

Specialty drugs (biologics), flares requiring urgent care, surgeries (joint replacement), ongoing therapy.

What you can do

Today: Ask about biosimilars and assistance programs; verify formulary status.

This week: Review expected annual OOP and plan timing for refills/coverage phases.

Ongoing: Keep function-focused care plan (PT/exercise) to reduce flares and downstream costs.

Stats

Medicare Part D RA biologics: projected annual out-of-pocket mean $4,613 in 2019.

Total national arthritis-attributable medical expenditures + earnings losses: $303.5B in 2013.

8) Alzheimer’s & other dementias

Card summary
Long-term care needs plus caregiver time and out-of-pocket expenses can be financially destabilizing for families over years.

How it affects an individual financially

Long-term services/support (home care, assisted living, nursing facilities) can dominate household budgets.

Families often absorb costs through unpaid caregiving and direct out-of-pocket spending.

Caregiving demands can reduce income due to fewer work hours.

High-cost triggers

Escalation of care needs, safety-related home changes, long-term care placement, repeated medical events.

What you can do

Today: Identify immediate care support needs and ask the clinic about caregiver resources/respite.

This week: Start planning documents (care coordination permission, meds list, emergency plan).

Ongoing: Reassess care level and financial eligibility for support programs.

Stats

Projected 2025 dementia health + long-term care costs: $384B, with $97B out-of-pocket.

Caregivers’ average annual out-of-pocket cost $7,200, rising to nearly $9,000 for dementia caregivers.

Estimated lifetime total cost of dementia care: $405,262 (2024 dollars).

CF spotlight (place right before or right after the Top 8 grid)
Cystic fibrosis (CF)

Card summary
CF care is specialized and long-term; high-cost therapies and frequent monitoring can create major cost exposure even with insurance.

How it affects an individual financially

Specialty medications and CFTR modulators can be extremely expensive; coverage often involves prior auth and strict formulary rules.

Routine CF center visits, labs, imaging, and exacerbation care can add recurring costs.

Time burden (appointments, treatments) can impact work/school stability.

High-cost triggers

Hospitalizations for exacerbations, transplant evaluation, high-cost specialty drugs.

What you can do

Today: Contact CF Foundation Compass for insurance/financial/legal help.

This week: Build a “coverage + prior auth” checklist with your CF care team.

Ongoing: Track renewal dates (PA, specialty pharmacy requirements) to prevent gaps.

Stats

Privately insured per-patient spending nearly doubled from ~$67k (2010–2011) to ~$131k (2016).
